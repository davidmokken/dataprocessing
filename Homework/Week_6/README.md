To demonstrate the percentage of "believers" vs "non-believers" per province in the Netherlands
    Can be seen for three years. Once clicked on a province, percentage of different faiths is shown in a bar/pie chart
    Also a bar chart for amount of visits to religious instances is shown
    (Maybe a bit much?)
